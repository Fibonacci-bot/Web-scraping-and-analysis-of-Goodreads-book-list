# Web scraping and analysis of Goodreads book list
Web scraping Goodreads book list using Python and BeautifulSoup library along with quick data analysis in Python with pandas and matplotli

I was interested in what kinds of books are most often recommended in the most popular book list on Goodreads so I decided to use web scraping to gather information about top 100 books in [Books That Everyone Should Read At Least Once](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/264.Books_That_Everyone_Should_Read_At_Least_Once) . Below you can find all the information I decided to gather.

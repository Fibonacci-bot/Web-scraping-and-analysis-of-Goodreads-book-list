# Web_Scraping_Goodreads
Web scraping Goodreads book list using Python and BeautifulSoup library

I was interested in what kind of books are most often recommended in the most popular book list on Goodreads so I decided to use web scraping to gather information about top 100 books in [Books That Everyone Should Read At Least Once](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/264.Books_That_Everyone_Should_Read_At_Least_Once) . Below you can find all the information I decided to gather.

1. Title
2. Link
3. Author
4. Average rating
5. Score
6. Number of pages
7. Genre
